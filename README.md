**The Minecraft Mod ASU is no longer being developed**

It was mostly just a test and to have some fun with mechanics. It was also to help learn some basic Java. And because of this, don't blame me if there are way more efficient ways of doing things.

Also, this is no longer being worked on, so don't expect me to respond or change much. However will stay here for either later reference, or a continuation and maybe if i'm really bored, I will update it for the fun of it.
